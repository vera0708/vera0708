## About myself:

Having started my career as economist, I have been employed for several years in the finance/economic field before turned to University.

After I have defended my dissertation in 2013, I joint the Tomsk Polytechnic university as an associate professor. Courses taught: «Information technologies in accounting», «Customer-oriented technologies», «Management of online projects» and so on. I created online courses of these disciplines on MOODL during the pandemic. 

I am planning to change my career mastering IT-skills and knowledge focusing on the front-end. I’m interested in Web developement due to the unlimited opportunities for professional growth if you have ability to learn and to gain new skills and expertise.
